Proposed improvements for objconv
=================================

* Use container classes as intermediate format:
-----------------------------------------------
The conversion between different object file formats would be simpler
and easier to maintain if all sections, symbols, and relocations were
first stored in containers in the same way as is done for conversion
to assembly. The containers would be something like
CSList<SASection> Sections;
CSList<SARelocation> Relocations;
CSList<SASymbol> SymbolList;

However, I don't have the time for doing such a radical restructuring
of the code, and the need for conversion of object files is now quite low.
